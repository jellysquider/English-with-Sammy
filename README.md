# English-with-Sammy
This repository is created for our CMPS 115 project at UC Santa Cruz.
We are implementing a website where users could learn English words by playing short interactive games.
This project is expected to be completed in 5 weeks according to our SCRUM plan.

### For local development and testing
1. Clone the repository
2. Install [npm, node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli) (skip if you have that)
3. Go to "/functions" and run `npm update` (Note: it might ask you to run `firebase login` if you haven't logged in before)
4. Within the same folder run `npm run serve`
5. Your local Sammy will be hosted on a `8000` port
6. Visit `localhost:8000` in your browser and have fun!
